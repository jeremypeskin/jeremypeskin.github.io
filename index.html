            <h2>A:</h2>
            <p>Yes. Canadians, and citizens of other countries as well, can visit their company's US offices and engage in activities which are consistent with being a business visitor without the need for a work visa. Activities which are allowed include attending meetings, visiting facilities, participating in short term trainings, giving a presentation, receiving an award, and the like. Moreover, Canadians can actually be admitted as a business visitor right at the US border without first getting a visa from a US consulate. The key thing here is that someone coming as a business visitor cannot be labor for hire – so they can not be put on a US company or affiliate's payroll while in that status.</p>
